Of course not!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the founder of TUX, I struggled with this notion for years. I dealt with feelings of shame for not being an industry specialist.

My young ego was pleased with the glossy page, but today I realize that the article instilled a lingering feeling that remained with me. In hindsight, it suggested that I wasn’t taking the proper time to perfect my expertise, as if it were a mistake to pursue all of my interests. It made me feel like a cheat.

All those years of “variable practice” make professional growth seem slower at first. It can be frustrating to see others specialize and rapidly sharpen their craft and get rewarded for it. But you have to understand that while specialists experience logarithmic professional growth, the compounded knowledge of generalists eventually kicks in exponentially. Through their first sampling phase, generalists gather a broader toolbox of flexible knowledge that ultimately unlocks the superpower of transfer. This is the ability to identify the deeper structure of a problem rather than just diving in and executing procedures a million times.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGeneralists don’t implement cookie-cutter solutions; they train to troubleshoot and problem-solve by finding or creating the correct solution. What we oﬀer at TUX is a more robust thinking system that draws from many diﬀerent sets of tools and experiences. For a project, you meet with planners, designers, coders, producers, and media specialists – all of whom have developed a generalist mindset and are able to transfer knowledge.
